BuildChow
=========

BuildChow is the nickname for templates of JBoss Tools and Developer
Studio jenkins jobs.

By using templates we do not have to rely on jenkins UI to manually update jobs
or bulk-update in large set of config.xml files.

BuildChow uses http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder[Jenkins Job
Builder](jjb) from Openstack.org

== Requirements

. Python 2.7+
. Python PIP
. Git

On Fedora you get this by runing: `yum install -y python-pip git`

== How to use

First need to install jjb.

For now we use a custom fork since not all patches applied yet.

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/maxandersen/jenkins-job-builder@jbosstools
```

Once installed you can run the following to generate jobs into a folder named `generated`:

```
$ jenkins-jobs test config/ -o generated
```

Update jenkins-jobs on jenkins server

```
$ jenkins-jobs --conf etc/jboss-jenkins.ini update config/ 
```
