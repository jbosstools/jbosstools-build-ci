BuildChow
=========

BuildChow is the nickname for templates of JBoss Tools and Developer
Studio jenkins jobs.

By using templates we do not have to rely on jenkins UI to manually update jobs
or bulk-update in large set of config.xml files.

BuildChow uses http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder[Jenkins Job
Builder](jjb) from Openstack.org

== How to use

First need to install jjb:

```
$ pip install jenkins-job-builder
```

Once installed you can run the following to generate jobs into a folder named `generated`:

```
$ jenkins-jobs test config/ -o generated
```

Update jenkins-jobs on jenkins server

```
$ jenkins-jobs --conf etc/jboss-jenkins.ini update config/ 
```
